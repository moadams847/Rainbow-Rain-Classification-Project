# Classification of rainbows and raindrops using fastAI and Python.

A computer vision project using kaggle-downloaded data.

## Motivation

I just started the Fast.ai course, and I’m here to share what I’ve built and discovered. I’m not a renowned data scientist. It’s all about making time to learn and making mistakes.
